### Contents:

- Code to train and sample LSTM language models from raw text
- Code to find the [sentiment neuron](https://blog.openai.com/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/) discovered by openAI 
- Code to analyse and discover Part-of-Speech (POS) tags neurons
- A webapp to showcase the work done and experiment with the trained models

### How to run:
To launch the webapp run: 

    - git clone https://github.com/jacarvalho/concept_neurons
    - cd concept_neurons
    - docker build -t project .
    - docker run -it -p 5000:5000 -v /abs/path/to/directory/:/extern/data project
