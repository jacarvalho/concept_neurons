This folder contains the code and results developed during the master project.

It includes: 
- code to train and sample LSTM language models from raw text;
- code to find the sentiment neuron discovered by openAI;
- code to analyse and discover POS tags neurons.


Files / Directories:

- Dockerfile:
    - configures a docker environment to launch the webapp

- byte_LSTM:
    - python scripts to train and sample byte-language models using
      tensorflow and the riseml tool

- byte_LSTM_trained_models:
    - language models trained with the amazon product reviews and
      wikitext-103 datasets

- concept_neuron:
    - python scripts to analyse the concept neurons of the trained
      language models
